# Visual Studio Code - Settings

These are my personal settings for Visual Studio Code (VSCode). They are organized by different application areas and extensions.

## Creating VS Code Settings

1. Create the `.vscode` directory in the root of your workspace, and within it, create a `settings.json` file. You can then copy the settings there. Of course, you can also copy the file directly to that location.

## VS Code Extensions

For automatic installation of extensions, the **VSC Export & Import** extension is required. This must be installed first, after which all necessary extensions can be imported through it.

1. For the extension to find the _vsc-extensions.txt_ file, it must be copied to the root directory of your workspace. Multiple files can also be combined into one file or imported one after another.

2. Click on the search bar in the top center, type `>VSC Extensions Import` and press [Enter]. The file will be read and the extensions will be automatically installed.

## Can I use your settings?

**Yes!** you can. However, please note that all settings are customized to my needs and may change at any time. There might also be missing dependencies.
